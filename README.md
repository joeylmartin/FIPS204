##  FIPS 204 Lattice Visualization

This project is an implementation of FIPS-204 with a high-dimensional lattice viewing tool. This was done as a dissertation for my final year of my BSc Computer Science degree.


The FIPS-204 standard can be found [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final). A few permutations to the exact standard have been undertaken:
